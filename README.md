# Introduction to Algorithms

This is a set of programs that will be used for solving the problems
that are present in the Intro to Algorithms class on YouTube. 

This contains the class as taught in the lectures 
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtSuA80QTyo&list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb) and
references the class `Introduction to Algorithms` taught in the
Fall of 2011. The course number os 6.006 (Shame it is not 007).

This repo is going to contain code both in python and C, and each
lecture is going to have its own folder. The following folders
are covered:

1. Algorithmic Thinking, Peak Finding
